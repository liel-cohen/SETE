# SETE
Sequence-based ensemble learning approach for TCR epitope binding prediction

## Introduction
SETE is a novel lightweight TCR's binding Antigen prediction algorithm based on ensemble algorithm. Note that our model is designed for multi-classification problem and we will updated the model to make it has better performance.
